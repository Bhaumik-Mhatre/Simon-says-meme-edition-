Simon Says Game ðŸŽ®
This is a simple Simon Says game I created to learn and polish the jQuery skills I've acquired so far.

ðŸŒŸ How the Game Works:
A sequence will be displayed to the user.
The user must click on the buttons in the exact order of the sequence.
For each new level, only the newly added element in the sequence will be shown to the user, not the entire sequence from the beginning.
If the user clicks the buttons in the correct order, they advance to the next level.
If the user clicks a button out of sequence, a Game Over screen appears.
ðŸŒ€ A Fun Meme Twist:
Each button plays a meme sound when clicked or shown in the sequence!
Enjoy the laughs while you play. ðŸ˜„
ðŸŽ® Try it Out:
Test your memory, have fun with the sounds, and see how far you can go!

Happy gaming and Sayonara! ðŸ‘‹

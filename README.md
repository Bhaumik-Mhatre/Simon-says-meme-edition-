# Simon-says-meme-edition-

It is a simple simon says game I made to learn and polish my the jQuery i've leared soo far.
The game is simple, a sequence will be shown to the user and then user has to click on the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
As the user get promoted to the next level only the new element which has been added to the sequence will be shown to user and not the whole sequence every new level.
If the user clicks on the button in the correct order, the user gets promoted to the next level.
And if the user clicks on the button which is not in the sequence will get a game over screen.
The memes twist is that when a user click on a button or when the sequence is shown to user the button will make meme sounds.
Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
